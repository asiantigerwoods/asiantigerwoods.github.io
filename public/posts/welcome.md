Welcome

Hey, we're Obliq!

# We're excited to lead you on your fitness journey

Obliq is made up of six people with the goal to provide an enhanced experience while working out. We know how annoying it is to use spreadsheets, pencil & paper, and even your memory to keep track of your workout and progress. Our plan to fix this is through a free app that fits in your pocket!

## Why Obliq?

We're tired of seeing other workout apps overcharge you for features that we believe should be free. Why pay a monthly subscription to create multiple routines, view your progress, or access professional routines when there is a free alternative? The user's experience is our highest priority, so we'll actively listen to user feedback every step of the way.

The gym is a social place, so why not make our app the same? We know going to the gym with a partner helps with accountability and consistency, but it can be difficult to coordinate. Instead of solving this through scheduling, Obliq will allow you to see your friend's activity and compete in order to maintain accountability.

Only about 18% of people who have a gym membership go to the gym consistently [[1](https://www.ihrsa.org/publications/the-2018-ihrsa-health-club-consumer-report/)]. It can be demotivating to not see results in the mirror or to have a workout routine that feels stagnant and repetitive. Our way of combatting this with structured routines and detailed progress tracking.

Utilizing these features, you'll be able to kickstart your journey and start seeing results!

## What's the catch?

Ultimately, we also strive to be a platform for personal trainers and fitness professionals to share their routines and build a community with others. As part of this, we will give creators the option to monetize their services as an alternative to a relying solely on in-person training sessions.

You are not required to subscribe to any user to use the app. All the features mentioned above will remain free forever!

## Release Date

You'll be able to use Obliq by July 2023 with enhanced versions releasing later in the year. We'll be keeping you in the loop with regular blog posts about our development updates.
